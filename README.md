# Practicum 9.6.1 (HW-03)

Task 1:
1. Create your own type of exception.
2. Create an array of 5 different types of exceptions, including your own exception type.
3. Implement a TryCatchFinally statement that iterates for each type of the exception array (finally block is optional).
4. In the 'catch' block, display the exception message in the console.

Task 2:
1. Create a program that sorts the surnames of five people.
2. Sorting must be done using an event. Sorting should be performed when user enters 1 (sort A-Z) or 2 (sort Z-A). It's necessary to implement the check of the entered data through the TryCatchFinally construct using our own exception type.
